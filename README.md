Welcome to the Star Ratings App! This is a simple React application that generates star ratings based on the number of stars given. The app uses a function to create a string of filled and empty stars representing the rating with proper intuition of Problem in the code as well as in this Readme.

## üß† Intuition (SLICE FUNCTION EXPLAINED => See Code)
As we used 5 filled and 5 empty stars and used slice method here. Suppose I entered '1', then in slice method, 5 - stars meaning (5 - 1) becomes 4 so it will start from 4th star that is filled and 10 - stars meaning (10 - 1) becomes 9 so iterates from 4,5,6,7,8,9 where 5 to 9 are empty stars displaying 4 empty stars and one filled star.

## üëÄWhat's Inside

This project includes a simple React component that demonstrates the concept of star ratings. The main component, `App.js`, contains a function that generates star ratings based on a provided number of stars. The app then displays example ratings using this function.

## üéØProject Aim

The aim of this project is to provide a clear and simple example of how to generate and display star ratings using React. It's a foundational example that can be expanded upon to include more advanced features or integrated into larger applications.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs!
